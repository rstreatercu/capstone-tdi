# College/University COVID-19 Resilience

In this project, I aim to investigate the resilience of various colleges and universities in the face of COVID-19, using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). I wish to determine the role that financial aid, student services staff funding and salary, electronic funding, and more played in determining the effect of COVID-19 on Fall 2020 enrollment. Ultimately, I hope to answer the question: how can universities and colleges retain enrollment in the face of pandemics?
